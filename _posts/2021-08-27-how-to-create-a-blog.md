title: How do I setup my Blog?
---

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
I've always wanted to set up a minimalistic blog where I post my train of thoughts. Setting up a static HTML/CSS webpage isn't much work for a programmer.

But what if you don't want to spend time playing around with HTML/CSS layout and just want to get started with writing instead. Because this is what I wanted. I wanted to take a theme aleady available and just start publishing.

<h3>Why should I have a blog?</h3>
<p>
Well, it's not a must, but it's nice to have. For me this is kind of like a "tech diary".

Also, if you're applying for a job or something like that, it helps to have an online portfolio with your information and skillsets.
